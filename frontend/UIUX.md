## 🎨 UI / UX Design System

ReLoop adopts a **Minimalist UI** design approach with subtle **Soft Glass (Frost UI)** accents to balance trust, clarity, and modern Web3 interaction.

The design prioritizes **readability, transparency, and real-world familiarity**, ensuring that non-crypto users (e.g. car buyers, dealers) can understand and use the product without friction.

---

### Design Philosophy

* **Trust-first design** for Real World Assets
* **Web2 familiarity** with Web3 logic hidden under the hood
* **Clarity over decoration**, especially for prices and payouts
* **Visual explanation of resale economics**, not financial jargon

The UI is intentionally calm and professional, reflecting the seriousness of ownership, resale, and value distribution.

---

### Design Style

**Primary Style:**

* Minimalist UI

**Secondary Accent:**

* Frost UI (Soft Glass) — used sparingly

Soft glass effects are applied only to **informational layers**, such as modals and overlays, to help users understand resale flow without distracting from core actions.

---

### Color System

* **Primary Background:** Off-white / light neutral
* **Primary Text:** Dark charcoal / near-black
* **Accent Color:** Muted green (used to represent value flow and earnings)
* **Warning / Disclaimer:** Soft amber

The color palette is intentionally conservative to convey legitimacy and financial trust.

---

### Typography

* **Headings:** Inter / SF Pro / Satoshi
* **Body Text:** Inter
* **Numbers & Prices:** Monospaced variant for clarity

Typography hierarchy is emphasized to make prices, ownership status, and earnings immediately visible.

### Core UI Components

#### 1. Marketplace Listing

* Clean card layout
* Car image, price, year, mileage
* “Resale Loop Enabled” indicator
* No crypto-specific terminology

#### 2. Asset Detail Page

* Large visual focus on the asset
* Clear purchase and resale actions
* **Resale Flow Visualization** showing how value loops back to previous owners

#### 3. Resale Flow Overlay (Frost UI)

* Soft glass modal
* Visual breakdown of profit distribution
* Used only for explanation, not navigation

#### 4. Portfolio & Earnings

* Asset ownership list
* Resale earnings history
* Clear separation between ownership and earnings

---

### What We Deliberately Avoid

* Token price charts
* APR / DeFi-style dashboards
* Neon colors or aggressive gradients
* Wallet-first onboarding
* Complex governance or DAO interfaces

ReLoop is a **resale marketplace**, not a trading terminal.

---

### UX Goal

A first-time user should be able to:

* Browse assets comfortably
* Understand resale value-sharing in under 30 seconds
* Trust the platform without knowing anything about blockchain

If the UI feels familiar, calm, and self-explanatory, the design has succeeded.

Core UI Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)
ReLoop is not a DeFi dashboard.
It should feel like:
a premium used-car marketplace
with invisible Web3 logic underneath
Design Pillars
Web2-first familiarity (cars, listings, history)
Visualized money flow (who earns on resale)
Minimal crypto exposure (wallet ≠ core UI)
Trust & legitimacy (very important for RWA)
If your UI feels like Uniswap → ❌
If it feels like Carvana + Stripe → ✅
